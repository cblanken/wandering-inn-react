Unfortunately after over 6 years of consistent publishing by the [author](https://www.patreon.com/pirateaba/about), it can be difficult to recall all the important details. As a reader myself who eventually caught up to the current releases after over a year of consistent reading, I thought having a tool to locate where in the text particular characters were introduced, when specific events occurred, and what elements of the _[Leveling]_ system I might have forgotten about.

At the start, this project only consisted of a few scripts that allowed me to lookup particular characters, _[Spells]_, _[Skills]_, _[Levels]_ and so on. But after some consideration it seemed like the perfect opportunity to build a database and learn more about React and play around with some data visuallization, so here we are.
